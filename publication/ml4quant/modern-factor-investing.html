<p>We give an overview of modern factor investing in this chapter. It is intended to be an introductory chapter to help readers get familiar with the quantitative finance framework. This chapter is adapted from our Webinar series <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Modern Factor Investing: Past, Present, Future</em></span>.</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/chapter3/nyc.jpeg" width="100%"></div>
<p>Over the last 50 years, academic researchers have made major breakthroughs in advancing classical practice in finance, from fundamental analysis to scientific quantitative research. These include portfolio theory, corporate finance, financial engineering of derivative instruments, and many other applications pertaining to financial markets overall. One of the foundational pillar is the advances in capital market theory in the context of descriptive equilibrium propositions in terms of the risk/return tradeoff and the linear factor model to explain the expected asset price, beginning with William F. Sharpe and the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</em></span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-sharpe1964capital" role="doc-biblioref">Sharpe 1964</a>)</span>. Many related academic developments provided rich asset pricing insight, including <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)</em></span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ross1976arbitrage" role="doc-biblioref">Ross 1976</a>)</span>, market efficiency proposition, market anomalies such as the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Fama and French factor model</em></span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-fama1993common" role="doc-biblioref">Fama and French 1993</a>)</span>, and behavioral finance. These altogether gave birth to a new investment paradigm - <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>factor investing</em></span> and is widely adopted in finance industry - <em>classical finance textbooks usually end there.</em></p>
<p>The saying, <em>“change is the only constant in life”</em> is attributed to the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus around 500BC. This is even more prominent in the capital market. The evolution of financial market keeps testing the efficacy of the factor theory and model. Ever since the 2008 global financial crisis, we observe an seemingly irreversible performance decay of the traditional factor model that is solely based on conventional data and linear framework. In academia, there is also a replication crisis (or credibility crisis) raging on as <em>“most claimed research findings in financial economics are likely false.”</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-harvey2016and" role="doc-biblioref">Harvey, Liu, and Zhu 2016</a>)</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the <em><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/">Fourth Industrial Revolution</a></em> - <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>digitalization</em></span> - has already come, and <em><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/andrew-ng-why-ai-new-electricity">“AI is the new electricity”</a></em>. During this trend, factor models and strategies have not remained static. Factor models and investment strategies evolve gradually over time, reflecting the evolution of capital markets and advances in data science theories, data availability, and investment practice. The current innovation efforts in factor investing focus on exploiting new unstructured data sources - the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>alternative data</em></span>, applying new data science modeling techniques - <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>machine learning</em></span> - <em><span style="color:#504EFF">modern factor investing</span> starts here.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of our central themes is that if assets are priced rationally, variables that are related to average returns, such as size and book-to-market equity, must proxy for sensitivity to common (shared and thus undiversifiable) risk factors in returns — <span class="citation">Fama and French (<a href="references.html#ref-fama1993common" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of what drives asset returns has been a staple of neoclassical finance and remains a holly grail. The factor model emerged and became a foundation of asset pricing theory in the 1960s <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lintner1969valuation" role="doc-biblioref">Lintner 1969</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-mossin1966equilibrium" role="doc-biblioref">Mossin 1966</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-sharpe1964capital" role="doc-biblioref">Sharpe 1964</a>; and <a href="references.html#ref-treynor1961toward" role="doc-biblioref">Treynor 1961</a>)</span>. In general, <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Factor</em></span> can be defined as any underlying characteristic relating a group of assets (e.g., equity, bond) that is linearly significant in explaining their return and risk.</p>
<p><span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Factor investing</em></span> refer to the general use of factors in the investment process. It is trustworthily a quantitative paradigm in investment where factor models renders return prediction signal, forecast expected asset risk, and drive asset allocation decisions by using the tradable factor portfolios. Practically, factor-driven investment strategies such as smart beta products amount to $800 billion AUM worldwide <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-johnson2018etf" role="doc-biblioref">Johnson 2018</a>)</span> — yes, we are talking about a magnificent investment topic that may affect everyone’s saving pension.</p>
<p>As is recognized by <span class="citation">Fama and French (<a href="references.html#ref-fama1993common" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>, firm characteristics (or factors) are associated with the cross-section of expected returns. Assuming individual asset return <span class="math inline">\(r_{i,t}\)</span>, factor loadings <span class="math inline">\(z_{i,t}\)</span> and factor return <span class="math inline">\(f_t\)</span>, factor model linearly specifies the relationship:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:facmodel">\[\begin{equation} 
r_{i,t} = z'_{i,t-1}  f_t + \alpha_{i,t} + u_{i,t}
\tag{3.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Where, <span class="math inline">\(u_{i,t}\)</span> it the noise term with expected zero return and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i,t}\)</span> is the intercept term of common OLS regression.</p>
<p>Now that we have the mathematical formulation, we delve into the granular categories of the factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="color:#504EFF"><strong>Beta factors</strong></span> — factors corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(f_t\)</span> are generally referred as “risk premia factors”, which have reflected exposure to sources of systematic risk and are supposed to earn a persistent significant risk-compensated premium over long periods (<span style="color:#504EFF"><em>if all model assumptions work…</em></span>).</p>
<p>In practice, they are called “beta factors” or “style factors” to denote that they are the drivers of systematic return and risk of assets. Furthermore, they are usually associated with the systematic risk that is inherent in market.</p>
<p>Here the risk premium reward could be thought as selling insurance products to Mr. Market. You undertake the risk to receive a positive reward on average in the long-term, when the risk does happen, Mr Market will come to you for coverage and you suffer a realized loss that should be well anticipated. If you believe the game is fair then you agree with the philosophy of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp">passive investing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color:#504EFF"><strong>Alpha factors</strong></span> — some other factors fall into the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i,t}\)</span> term as they do not explain the risk well (e.g., <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>they are not volatile</em></span>) and can not be included into the linear terms, yet they do earn persistent return over time with some predictive value to result in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i,t} \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Alpha factor model are designed to forecast excess return of stocks. If return distribution is characterized by the expected return and the standard deviation, it is often the expected return predicted by alphas that determines whether we buy or sell, overweight or underweight, and the standard deviation driven by betas that determines the size of the portfolio allocations to hedge the undesirable systematic risk - this is the monologue of hedge funds or active investment.</p>
<p>Efficient market theory forbids the existence of alpha and the academia call them <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>“anomaly”</em></span>, however, hedge fund active managers rely on them and <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>some HFs seem to live well</em></span>. The alpha factors are often called “signal” by practitioners to distinguish from the beta risk premia factors.</p>
<p>The alpha signals are often proprietary and highly guarded, reflecting creativity as well as superior systems. It is the most important differentiator within the investment firm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors are the bedrock of quantitative investment management and have served the needs of investors for a long time. For equities, in addition to countries and industries, accounting-based fundamental factors documented through empirical research and used extensively in portfolio management include value, size, momentum, volatility, quality, yield, growth, and liquidity. A similar set of common macro drivers has been identified and used across asset classes, including equity, rates, credit, and real assets.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> 50 Years of Factor Investing: A Literature Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#years-of-factor-investing-a-literature-review"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Factor research has been prevalent for over 50 years. The oldest and most well-known model of stock returns is the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</em></span>, which is in essence a single-factor model with market as the sole factor (see <span class="citation">Sharpe (<a href="references.html#ref-sharpe1964capital" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>). In other words, the expected return to any stock could be viewed as a function of its beta factor loading to the market . This won William Sharpe a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Later, <span class="citation">Ross (<a href="references.html#ref-ross1976arbitrage" role="doc-biblioref">1976</a>)</span> proposed the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Arbitrage pricing theory (APT)</em></span> holds that the expected return of a financial asset can be modeled as a function of various macroeconomic factors or theoretical market indexes, thus introducing the “multi-factor models”. Moreover, unlike the CAPM, APT theoretically validated that the number and nature of the APT factors were likely to change over time and vary across markets. Hence, the challenge shifts to build up the empirically sound factor models.</p>
<p>Beyond the market factor, researchers generally look for risk premium factors that are <em>persistent over time</em> and have strong explanatory power over a <em>broad range of stocks</em>. There are three main categories of factors today: macroeconomic, statistical, and fundamental.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Macroeconomic factors include measures such as surprises in inflation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-chen1986economic" role="doc-biblioref">Chen, Roll, and Ross 1986</a>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Statistical factor models identify factors where the factors are not pre-specified in advance <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-chamberlain1983arbitrage" role="doc-biblioref">Chamberlain 1983</a>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Fundamental factors are the mostly widely used and credit to <span class="citation">Fama and French (<a href="references.html#ref-fama1993common" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>. They put forward a model explaining US equity market returns with three fundamental actors: the <em>Market</em>, the <em>Size</em>, and the <em>Value</em>. The “Fama-French” model, which today includes <span class="citation">Carhart (<a href="references.html#ref-carhart1997persistence" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> <em>Momentum</em> factor, has become a canon within the finance literature. – Fama also later got a Nobel Prize.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In another vein, <span class="citation">Rosenberg (<a href="references.html#ref-rosenberg1974extra" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> described the importance of the stock fundamental traits in explaining variation of stock returns, leading to the creation of the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>multi-factor Barra risk models</em></span> which is still the dominant risk model in equity investment.</p>

</h2>
<p>The enduring success of fundamental factors stems from the fact that they are guided by academic theory, and, importantly, are supported by empirical evidence and reflect investment practice, i.e., they make money. However, the story of factors turn into a horror fiction ever since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. It is not only that some well-acclaimed factors that outperform in the past start to underperform (Fama-French’s Value factor is lacklustre, see Figure <a href="modern-factor-investing.html#fig:fig-fac-decay">3.1</a>), but also there are some lurking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan events</a> that causing extreme outliers where the model could fail drastically. In statistics, this is usually associated with the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>heavy-tailed</em></span> distribution and we could remove or winsorize those data points as outliers when fitting a model. Nevertheless, in reality, these outliers may mean you are doomed all at once.</p>
<div class="figure">

Figure 3.1: Recent performance decay of Fama-French factor portfolios in US market
</p>
</div>
<p>To make a concrete example, lets remember David Viniar’s, once the CFO of Goldman Sachs, famous <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>25 sigma</em></span> when Goldman’s flagship GEO hedge fund had lost 27% in 2007: <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>“We were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row.”</em></span>. One commentator wryly noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That Viniar. What a comic. According to Goldman’s mathematical models, August, Year of Our Lord 2007, was a very special month. Things were happening that were only supposed to happen once in every 100,000 years. Either that … or Goldman’s models were wrong (Bonner, 2007b).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A direct implication is that the normality assumption of linear models does not hold in financial market, thereby significantly weakening the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>statistical inference</em></span> power in quantitative fiance. The p-value and relevant test statistics should thus be interpreted with extreme caution or neglected altogether. We empirically recommend the latter.</p>
<p>More importantly, the underlying linearity assumption itself is an unrealistic assumption and we have witness a great amount of evidence on <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>non-linearity</em></span> breaking this fundamental assumption. One of the straightforward counterexample is the interaction effect as one factor’s contribution to the asset’s expected return may rely on other factors. Furthermore, there could be more complex pattern that certain factor exerts on the asset return and risk. You should forget about the theoretical unbiasedness credit to linear model when entering the quantitative finance.</p>
Another interesting trend is the “factor zoo” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-harvey2019census" role="doc-biblioref">Harvey and Liu 2019</a>)</span>, which refers to a metaphor for the growing number of investment factors proposed by both academics and practitioners. Not considering the less famous journals or the mysterious industry, there are already hundreds of factors claimed to be effective and published in top academic journals.<br><div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>
<img src="images/chapter3/factor_zoo.png" alt="Out of control factor production (Harvey, 2019)" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 3.2: Out of control factor production (Harvey, 2019)
</p>
</div>
<p>It further points out to the multiple testing problem: <em>with so many factors tried, some will appear “significant” purely by chance</em>, and further indicates the peril of data mining, which may or may not be intentional. From a data science perspective, this also leads to the <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>high-dimension</em></span> nature of the modern factor investing: we now have a “zoo” of available factor candidates and the traditional OLS linear regression is incompetent.</p>
<p>This is not to overlook the merits of linear model such as its transparency and interpretability. Given careful treatment and enhacncement such as regularization, linear model remains a competiteive baseline, especially in set-up with insufficient data input. However, its performance upper bound should not be inflated in the current data science world, with so many alternative and more expressive machine learning algorithms available: linear model is at most a parsimonious underfitted compromise (<em>think about those hundreds of factors!</em>) in face of the high noise-to-signal ratio financial data.</p>

</h2>
<p>What is Big Data? A wide array of information sensing devices as well as the cloud service technique has led to an exponential growth in available big datasets. Starting from handheld mobiles, cameras, microphones, Internets, digitalised map, Internet of Things (IoT), to LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors and satellite imaging. The amount of data that the world collects has experienced explosive growth. The rapid development of informative technologies has paved the way for a transition to digital world.</p>
<p>The rapid advancement in the Internet and social media sectors has far reaching effects not only on our day to day lives; but also, for finance researchers and investors. Quantitative finance is no longer a subclass of finance but arguably the whole finance is evolving into a data-driven scientific subject. There comes a fashionable term in the finance domain - <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>alternative data</em></span>.</p>
<p>Alternative data is data not typically used by researchers and model builders and can be sourced from a kaleidoscope of data sources ranging from text, audio, image, graph, etc. These data sets typically have minimal aggregation and processing making them more <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>difficult</em></span> to access and use. In the last several years, we have seen an explosion in the availability of new alternative data sources.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:unnamed-chunk-3"></span>
<img src="images/chapter3/alt_data.jpg" alt="Increasing number of alternative data vendors (Man Institute, 2019)" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 3.3: Increasing number of alternative data vendors (Man Institute, 2019)
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Some of the alternative data sets are market data that were previously difficult to access (e.g., analyst forecasts, insider transactions, options trading information, credit default swaps, and hedge fund positions). These data sets are available in numerical format and can be sourced from commercial vendors.</p></li>
<li><p>Other new data sets come in new atypical formats (e.g., text, audio, and video), and they can only be extracted from internet sites and social media. Investors may gain additional insights by processing and understanding the information contained in unstructured alternative data sets such as news reports, product reviews, employee reviews, job postings, regulatory filings, call transcripts, satellite images, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The new formats require new modeling techniques and powerful computers to extract information. Innovations in information technology such as cloud computing and bespoke microprocessors provide the computational firepower necessary to apply <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>machine learning</em></span> and other computationally intensive data science techniques on the new unstructured alternative data sets.</p>
<p><span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Natural language processing (NLP)</em></span> is one of the most exciting frontiers to bring alternative value to the factor investing framework. In essence, we could now leverage deep-learning based NLP model to extract value from text data in the financial domain. Financial sector accumulates large amount of financial communication text. It is only the recent machine learning breakthrough of general <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</em></span> language model such as BERT <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-devlin2018bert" role="doc-biblioref">Devlin et al. 2018</a>)</span> that makes the unstructured text data become a goldmine to generate value for quantitative finance. Due to its unique data source, NLP-based factors tend to have a merit of <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>being orthogonal to existing fundamental factors</em></span> with less multicollinearity issue. It is thus pivotal to note that NLP-based factors could actually complement the existing factors, instead of the disrupting them overall. We will give a detailed introduction of Financial NLP in the latter sections, which well deserve a chapter in its own right.</p>
<p>In another vein, much of the efforts have been focused on employing modern high-dimensional machine learning techniques to better model the asset returns now given the affluence of data source. Applying machine learning routines to financial data has been implicitly motivated by the AFA (American Finance Association) presidential address of Cochrane (2011), who suggests that in the presence of a vast collection of noisy and highly correlated return predictors, there is a need for other methods beyond cross-sectional linear regressions. Indeed, <span style="color:#504EFF"><em>machine learning</em></span> offers a natural and theoretical-sound way to accommodate a high-dimensional predictor set and flexible functional forms, and it employs “regularization” methods to select models, mitigate overfitting biases, and uncover complex patterns and hidden relationships.</p>
<p>There has been an emerging body of pioneer academic work that reports phenomenal investment profitability based on signals generated by machine learning methods, let alone the long data science enthusiasm from investment industry. A funny observed phenomenon to echo this trend is that nowadays Machine Learning PhDs are more likely to land a researcher job in quantitative Hedge Funds than those pure Finance PhDs.</p>
<p>We list some most influential machine learning in factor investing papers in the table <a href="modern-factor-investing.html#tab:ML-factor-tab">3.1</a> as a roadmap of the recent modern factor investing. The predictors column refer to the input features the research use to predict the stock returns, where <em>Firm</em> stands for typical firm-level factors and <em>Macro</em> represents the macro indicator. In the forthcoming sections we will deep dive into some most representative ones (e.g., IPCA by <span class="citation">Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (<a href="references.html#ref-kelly2019characteristics" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) alongside introducing the corresponding machine learning algorithm.</p>

<p>Factor investing is a <em>paradigm in quantitative finance</em> of more than 50 years history by linearly describing the asset return and risk using the effective and intuitive asset characteristics - <em>factors</em>. It enjoys academic acclaim and is fundamentally adopted by industry.</p>
<p>The recent performance decay of conventional factors points to the limitedness of the classical linear factor model. Moreover, the continued growing number of investment factors proposed by both academics and practitioners leads to a high-dimensional “factor zoo” in current factor world and the traditional linear regression thus become incompetent.</p>
<p>Current innovation efforts in factor investing focus on exploiting new unstructured data sources, applying new data science modeling techniques such as machine learning to harness the high-dimensional factors and identify the evolving complex market payoff pattern.</p>
