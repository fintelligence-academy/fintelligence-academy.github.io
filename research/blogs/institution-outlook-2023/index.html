<p class="copy-width">To kickstart the new year, Bloomberg News has gathered more than 500 calls from Wall Street’s army of strategists to paint the investing landscape ahead. And upbeat forecasts are hard to find, threatening fresh pain for investors who’ve just endured the great crash of 2022.</p>    
<p class="copy-width">开启新的2023，Bloomberg News收集了来自华尔街的500多种观点，描绘了未来的投资前景。很难找到乐观的预测，这对刚刚经历了2022年市场崩盘的投资者来说可能会带来新的痛苦。</p>   

<p class="copy-width">Barclays Capital Inc. says 2023 will go down as one of the worst for the world economy in four decades. Ned Davis Research Inc. puts the odds of a severe global downturn at 65%. Fidelity International reckons a hard landing looks unavoidable.</p>     
<p class="copy-width">Barclays Capital表示，2023年将成为40年来世界经济最糟糕的一年。 Ned Davis Research将全球经济严重衰退的可能性定为 65%。Fidelity认为硬着陆似乎不可避免。</p>  

<p class="copy-width">As the Federal Reserve ramps up its most aggressive tightening campaign in decades, the consensus view is that a recession, albeit mild, will hit both sides of the Atlantic with a high bar for any dovish policy pivot, even if inflation has peaked.</p>      

<p class="copy-width">随着美联储加大其几十年来最激进的紧缩行动，人们普遍认为，即使通胀已经见顶，经济衰退也会对大西洋两岸造成影响，即使通胀已经见顶，也很难采取任何温和的政策转向。</p>



<p class="copy-width">Still, humility is the order of the day for prognosticators who largely failed to predict the 2022 cost-of-living crisis and double-digit market losses. This time around, the consensus could prove badly wrong once again, delivering a host of positive surprises. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and UBS Asset Management, for their part, see the economy defying the bearish consensus as price growth eases — signaling big gains for investors if they get the market right.</p> 
<p class="copy-width">尽管如此，对于在很大程度上未能预测到2022年生活成本危机和两位数市场损失的机构预测者来说，机构预测错误是家常便饭。这一次，对于2023年的看跌共识可能再次被证明是严重错误的，而这将为市场带来许多积极的超预期惊喜。就高盛、摩根大通和瑞银而言，他们认为随着价格增长放缓，经济将打破看跌共识——这表明如果投资者正确把握市场的走向，他们将获得巨大收益。</p>

<p class="copy-width">Expect an uneven year in trading. Deutsche Bank AG sees the S&amp;P 500 Index rising to 4,500 in the first half, before falling 25% in the third quarter as a downturn bites — only to bounce back to 4,500 by end-2023 as investors front-run a recovery.</p>     

<p class="copy-width">今年的预期交易将是不平衡的。德意志银行预计，美股标准普尔500指数上半年将升至 4,500 点，然后在第三季度因经济低迷而下跌 25%，但随着投资者抢先复苏，到2023年底将反弹至 4,500 点。</p>     



<p class="copy-width">Perhaps the easy money will be made in bonds at long last. After the asset class delivered the biggest loss in the modern era last year, UBS Group AG expects US 10-year yields will drop to as low as 2.65% by the end of the year on juicy coupons and renewed haven demand.</p>      

<p class="copy-width">也许轻而易举的收益最终会在债券上赚到。在该资产类别去年出现现代最大损失后，瑞银预计美国10年期国债收益率将在年底前跌至 2.65% 的低位，原因是高息票息和新的避险需求。</p>     

<p class="copy-width">Below presents the detailed 2023 outlook summary from institutional investors, covering Base Case, Growth, Recession, Inflation, Monetary Policy, US, China, Europe, UK, Japan, Pivot, Dollar, Earnings, and other major categories.</p>

<p class="copy-width">以下是机构投资者对2023年市场展望的详细总结，涵盖基本情景（Base Case）、增长（Growth）、经济衰退（Recession）、通胀（Inflation）、货币政策（Monetary Policy）、美国、中国、欧洲、英国、日本、联储加息转向（Fed Pivot）、美元（Dollar）、收益（Earnings）和其他主要类别。</p>

Bonds are back, market valuations are more attractive, and a Fed pivot in the first part of the year should trigger interesting entry points. </p> </li>   <li class="event-item">  <p class="gfx-copy gfx-copy-bold gfx-copy-medium"> <span>AXA Investment Managers</span> </p> <p class="gfx-copy gfx-copy-medium"> A policy-induced recession looks like the price to pay to get inflation back under control after a peak in late 2022. While we are confident that by the middle of 2023 the world economy will start improving again, we would warn against any excessive enthusiasm. Beyond the cyclical recovery, many structural questions will remain unanswered. </p> </li>   <li class="event-item">  <p class="gfx-copy gfx-copy-bold gfx-copy-medium"> <span>Bank of America</span> </p> <p class="gfx-copy gfx-copy-medium"> Going into 2023, one expected shock remains: recession. The US, euro area and UK are all expected to see recessions next year, and the rest of the world should continue to weaken, with China a notable exception. The recession shock likely means corporate earnings and economic growth will come under pressure in the first half of the year, while at the same time, China’s reopening offers a reprieve for certain assets. </p> </li>   <li class="event-item">  <p class="gfx-copy gfx-copy-bold gfx-copy-medium"> <span>Barclays</span> </p> <p class="gfx-copy gfx-copy-medium"> This year’s aggressive rate hikes should hit the world economy mainly in 2023. We expect advanced economies to slip into recession, and we forecast global growth at just 1.7%, one of the weakest years for the world economy in 40 years.

Ten-year real yields retrace half of this year’s rise to end 2023 at 65bps. We expect 10-year Bunds and Gilts to underperform Treasuries as “single mandate” ECB and BOE stay on hold for longer.

US equities are pricing in only a 41% probability of recession, compared to 80% in Europe (which is already in recession) and 64% for China. The decline in stocks thus far can be fully explained by the rise in real rates and widening of spreads. The growth downturn is yet to be priced.

The labor market will certainly cool, but healthy household balance sheets should continue to support spending in the services sector.
